Our inspiration for this project was The New York Times' <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/projects/2012/snow-fall/">Snowfall</a> article, which came out in 2012 and adopted an interactive and immersive way of storytelling to create a brilliant piece of journalism.<br><br>

Even then, NYT had a complete technical team to develop that article which a local news organization might not have. Our goal, was to give journalists and journalism organizations a tool that made it fairly simple to create immersive and minimalistic articles on the web. Our goal was also to conduct research with journalists around this tool that we built.<br><br>

We realized that a lot of journalists and organizations use WordPress and decided to build a WordPress plugin that would bring this functionality to a user.<br><br>

While doing this we wanted to keep things modular for a user and decided to give them a block-wise structure to build a webpage with. That way a user works only with a block at a certain point of time and the development of the whole webpage isn't their focus.<br><br>

One of the more difficult questions we had to answer was <i>"What is the level of abstraction we want to create between a user and the code?"</i> Running through various use-cases in various itereations of the design process we came up with our current design where a user can jump into the code of the block they're building instantly using our <b>in-built code editor</b> and have access to the block's HTML and CSS and edit it inside Snowball itself.<br><br>

One other feature we were very certain we wanted was the <b>live perview</b>. As developers we understand its importance and wanted to bring that to our users. But the bigger question was whether we give the user a block-wise preview or a preview of the complete webpage? In our design process we realized that a page preview wasn't ideal and didn't comply with our modular structure and hence, today we have a block wise live preview.<br><br>

We have also constantly been in touch with a team at Mozilla because of our idealogical similarites with their Webmaker project. Right now we are working with Drexels student run newspaper, The Triangle to do a study with Snowball.
