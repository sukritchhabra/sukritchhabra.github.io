                <p class="headerContent intro">
                    I had experienced WordPress first hand and had sworn to never go back to it. There are a lot of things that are right with WordPress but it isn't for everyone. If you're a developer and want control over everything you do within WordPress, let me assure you, its going to be very hard to be satisfied with WordPress.<br><br>

                    While interviewing for Co-Op jobs I interviewed with Thomas Park. All I knew at this point was the title of the job, i.e., Research Assistant and Web Developer. Upon interviewing with Tom he told me about this idea of a tool for journalists and smaller newspapers to create immersive articles without much effort on the internet. He showed me an article called <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/projects/2012/snow-fall/">Snowfall by the New York Times</a> as a reference to what we want the users of the tool to be able to build. I have to admit, I was blown away by the article. I had seen articles like it before but none that conveyed a story as well as Snowfall did.<br><br>

                    One caveat. Tom was thinking of building it as a WordPress plugin. I must have gone on and on about how I didn't like Wordpress, what was wrong with it and why it is wrong CMS to be working with. After the interview, my only hope, was that Tom doen't pick WordPress, even if he doesn't pick me for the job, he just shouldn't go with WordPress.<br><br>

                    Fortunately, through the selection process I was chosen. Along with another student here at Derxel. The first couple of weeks were kind of an introduction to the job. Geting IRB certified. Understanding the work Tom and Andrea (Dr. Andrea Forte) were doing and what my role was going to be in all this. Working on some prototypes for Mozilla.<br><br>

                    A little while later, we were going to start working on this tool. I remember a conversation where Tom asked me and Brian (the other student) how we would want to build the tool, as a web-app or a WordPress plugin? I distinctly remember feeling this was a rhetorical question since I had already expressed my emotions towards WordPress. Turns out it wasn't. Which was probably for the better. We discussed the pro's and con's of each, what our aim was and what we were trying to achieve with this tool. We realized that the population we would be building this tool for, i.e., journalists or smaller news organizations, have built their websites on WordPress. As much as I hated it at that point, WordPress was definitely a better choice for us.<br><br>
                </p>

                <section id="idea" class="contentSection">
                    <h3>The Idea</h3>
                    <p class="headerContent">
                        We ironed out what was the <i>"thing"</i> that we wanted to build. We wanted to build a tool, now a WordPress plugin, that would allow journalists and smaller news organizations to build immersive and minimalistic articles for the web without having too much or for that matter any coding knowledge. This was going to be the difference. With an article like Snowfall, The New York Times had a development team that created this interactive and fantastic experience around the text of the article. We wanted anybody without a development team or any programming background be able to create an article like Snowfall. At this point you may feel tha I'm giving unnatural attention to Snowfall and you're probably correct. But its not because it is the only article on the web that does this but because it was the one that inspired <b>us</b>.<br><br>

                        But we didn't want to just create this tool. We also wanted to do some research with it. Andrea and Tom had done some work earlier where they had studied the computational pedagogical effects of some tools that they had built (OpenHTML and the Nester Study). We wanted to do something along the same lines. We wanted to see what educational effect could this tool have on someone who is compltely astray to programming. We didn't know how at this point but we hoped we could.<br><br>

                    <h3>Research before development</h3>
                    <p class="headerContent">
                        We began by looking up other articles like Snowfall, just to get a general idea of the kind of article that were being built on the internet. We were looking for three things basically. One, clean and immersive articles. Two, Good story-telling. And finally, <b>parallax</b>. I cannot remember why, but, we were looking for parallax. But, if any article had any of the above two qualities, it made my <span class="displayList"><b>list</b><span class="fa fa-caret-down"></span></span>.

                        We took inspiration from a lot of these articles in terms of what our users should be able to build using our plugin. But the kind of customization these articles require could never be hardcoded into the plugin. Customization being hard-coded seems kind of contradictory but what that would amout to is themes. If we picked an article from the above list and built our plugin so that a user could enter their content and the style of their webpage would be based off of this article, that would imply that we are theming the page to the article we chose. That is something we <strong>didn't</strong> want to do.<br><br>

                        We also looked at other WordPress plugins that might doing something similar to what we had planned. We found a tool called <a href="http://www.scrollkit.com/">Scroll Kit</a>. From what I understand Scroll Kit was trying to do exactly what we wanted. Allow users to create complex article with ease. The reason we found them is because they had a very peculiar connection to Snowfall. The New York Times came with a legal battle against Scroll Kit because Cody Brown, one of the Co-Founders, replicated Snowfall in a video to display how easy it would be to recreate the article. Complete story <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/the-new-york-times-versus-scroll-kit-2013-5" target="_blank">here</a>.<br><br>

                        At first this shocked me. And then it worried me. In that moment of concern I asked Tom if we were going to get sued by the New York Times. His laughing reposnse complemented the rhetorical and comedic nature of the question and made me feel a lot more confident that we weren't. It is six months later and thankfully that hasn't happened.<br><br>

                        We also had alot of conversations about <b>how</b> a user would navigate and interact with our tool? How they would build their article? What would their process be? What'll be the easiest and the most convenient way for them? How this will work within WordPress? How would WordPress limit or enable our users? How could we use WordPress to make the experience better? If you're expecting the answers to these questions below, I'm not sure you'll find all of them in the text but you'll probably see some here and there and in the our plugin itself.<br><br>

                    <h3>Design</h3>
                    <p class="headerContent">
                        One of our first solutions was to have a modular/block-wise approach. We would allow the user to build the webpage one block at atime. It sounds crude and did to me at the time too but that is what the Design phase is for. A user would handle one block on the page (text, image, video, etc) <b>at a time</b>. Their focus would be on one block, build it, and then think about another block. One other feature we very very certain we wanted was the <b>live preview</b>. We were also very keen on having an <b>inbuilt code editor</b> that would allow the users to completely customize the webpage to their liking if they wanted to. This would also help us with the pedagogical study we wanted to do. We set out designing with these ideas.<br><br>

                        We started with paper prototypes. The first thing I did was try to create a layout for the plugin. I came up with several layouts that I thought would be optimal for our needs. For each of these layouts I added our modules on top and user interactions to go with these modules. At this point, I have bad news. I was really hoping I could scan these protoypes and put them up here, but about two months ago the stack of paper that we didn't need anymore was rising and we decided to get rid of it. I really wanted the the readers, you guys to see those prototypes but nothing I can do now. Hell, I'll draw them out from memory and add them later.
                    </p>

                    <p class="headerContent">
                        We had a solid base in these paper prototypes. We studied them and enhanced them to create a more solid idea of what we were going to build. The ideas kept on evolving and the designs evolved with them. We mapped out other features like <b>draggable blocks</b>, <b>preview interactions</b>, <b>copying blocks</b> and many others. We kept on working and showing our prototypes to Tom. Somewhere in my heart I wanted to extend the design phase forever because I knew the next stage was development and that I would have to use WordPress and I just didn't want to go there! But soon, I ran out of ideas. This is when we picked up all of our prototypes and culminated the best ideas from them into one single drawing using one block. This is where we reached.

                        It was time. The moment that I'd been dreading since I got this job was this moment. It was going to be a horrible Monday. Tom came in and I knew we were going to talk about development today and I knew we were going to talk about WordPress and I knew I wanted to kill myself. I was just hoping that Tom would've had an epiphany and was going to say, "Ok guys, I've decided that WordPress is not the right choice for us and so our only option is a web-app!" He came in, waved his hand to say hi, sat down right across from me and said, "So, did you guys take a look at the WordPress docs?" I had, in my complete abstinence from anything WordPress related forgotten that Tom had asked us to go over the WordPress Documentation so that we had some idea before we began. And here I sat, with no idea about anything, making plans to somehow change their minds to go with a web-app.<br><br>

                        At this point I should be honest and tell you, that I wasn't a web-dev expert either. I barely had any experience with JavaScript. I studied jQuery for the Mozilla protypes over the weekend before the Monday we were going to start developing them! I was definitely getting better but didn't possess the experience to jump into a project head-on with JS. Sometimes I wonder why I ever got hired in the first place...<br>

                        That said, JavaScript was something that I was keen to learn whereas WordPress I knew I wouldn't be able to handle.<br><br>

                        Tom suggested we go over the docs and try to create something. This wasn't to get started on the plugin, this was to get us comfortable with WordPress. Yeah, like that was gonna happen. I finally started going over some WordPress documentations. Read a little about actions and hooks, but didn't really understand anything. Knowing myself, I went with a more hands-on approach. [At this point we were half-way throught he week.] I started looking at WordPress tutorials for beginners. Something that kept popping up again and again was a plugin example called <strong>Hello Dolly.</strong> And I decided to start there. Things seemed simple enough. It took me about one complete workday but I got a plugin like Hello Dolly working with lyrics from EMINEM's Mockinbird. Towards the end, just when I was feeling proud of my work, I realized how large the code for this plugin actually was. Roughly 60 lines! <strong>THATS IT!!!</strong> And basically what I had changed was the lyrics from Hello Dolly to Mockingbird.<br><br>

                        It slowly sunk in that I had no other choice and this was something I was going to have to do. I kept on working through the week. Slowly I was starting to understand PHP. But WordPress was still lost on me. Their architecture seemed vague and docs incomplete. If somebody had asked a question on the WordPress forums, WordPress has closed the thread without the question being solved. It may seem like I'm bashing WordPress too much but believe me, I'm really trying to keep my prejudice aside and tell you just what I noticed.<br><br>

                        Anyways, I was getting frustrated and didn't know what I was trying to achieve. So I tried to figure out how to load a javascript file into WordPress. After about two hours (which seems too long now, but I'm sure would be the experience of several people who are new to WordPress) I'd figured it now. Now I could write jQuery and run this script on a page. But I still didn't know what I was trying to create. So I decided to work on the code editor and live preview together!. What a leap! I can say this about myself, I tend to set high targets! jQuery seemed easy and within the next hour or so I had this.<br><br>

                        I had a <code>textarea</code> whih was attributed to the h1 header. I was detecting a keyup in the <code>textarea</code> and when that event was triggered, I would parse the CSS that had been typed, extract the properties and their values and apply them to the header of the box. This was a similar to the approach I had followed with the Mozilla prototypes in the sense that it was exactly the same approach. The only difference being a GUI interface in the prototypes and a textarea here. But, I was finally making some progress. That day when Tom came in, Brian and I did some updates i think and then discussed our progress. We were all having some problems with WordPress. Tom suggested we, and by we I mean all three of us take a Team Treehouse course on WordPress. We had some discussion and decided we were going to do it.<br><br>

                        At this point I would like to take a breather from the whole development aspect and mention something. One of the things that really worked between the three of us was discussion. Anything we were going to do, we would discuss first. Go through all the perspectives, calculate all the pros and cons and then decide how we were going to do what we were going to do. I personally feel Tom was the enabler of this practice. When Brian and I would be working (and this is in the first two months of the job) we wouldn't talk too much about our work. One of us would, every once in a while, express their emotions about what they were doing in the most insignificant manner and then move on. But Tom would come in and enable this discourse where we could speak about what we've been doing individually and what we're going to do as a team. The fact that these conversations were mostly between the three of us may seem like a wierd dynamic but I think, it helped me a lot. Even though i'm praising this practice of ours, if it'd happened every single day, either between Brian and me or between all three of us, I know it would have hindered my process of learning and creativity therefore affecting the development. The fact that I could take a week, without any interuptions or changing methodologies and only a single goal in mind helped me learn more efficiently. I'm not saying that at the end of the week I would have a perfect solution/product, that honestly never happened. Whatever I would create would have several problems, but what I learn't during its creation is what was of value. If I had to work with constantly changing goals or processes, I wouldn't have been nearly as effective as I was.<br><br>

                        Moving on. We spent the next week taking the Treehouse lessons. I felt like I was starting to understand WordPress's architecture little by little. A couple of days later Tom came in. Sat down and said he had somethn to show us. OPen his laptop, and pulled it up. There it was, Snowball was a plugin. A working, functional, productive plugin. Not a prototype, a plugin. Seems kind of abrupt right? Did to me too! I was in awe! We were trying to understand WordPress and PHP but Tom was miles ahead of us! Not only that, he had an excellent architecture! Something that was completely modular yet somehow connected to everything. We were disucussing how and what he'd done and then what we were going to work on! I remember saying, "I'm going to take the next couple of days to go over all of the code you've written and understand how things are working right now." I felt like this might be a problem because we should start work on Snowball now that  we have a base but it wasn't at all. And I did exactly that.<br><br>

                        A few days later we sat down and decided how we were going to work. I was going to handle the modules. The good thing about this was that the modules had to be written only in HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The flipside of this was that I wasn't going to be wroking too much on the WordPress and PHP side of things. As thrilled as I was at that time, I would have liked to have invested more time into WP and PHP to learn them properly. But the beauty of the six months was that I always had the option to jump back and forth. The project couldn't have waited for me to become an expert at PHP and I could always do it on my own time. Also, I was completely frustrated and just wanted to leave WordPress and PHP alone! Plus, I believe, and this is just me, that Tom had set up the back-end pretty well and the majority of all our work was going to be mainly JavaScript.<br><br>

                        And this is where the actual development began. Module by module and feature by feature the plugin started coming together. There were times when I would be so lost into a module I was working on that I would completely loose sight of what Tom and Brian had been working on. Week by week the plugin gained functionality and our Github repo gained issues! Everyday we would come in and work on our stuff. When we would get slightly bored, we would take a look at our Guthub issues and pick up a bug-fix or a minor enhancement to work on and as soon as that was complete we would go back to our work. Our content types, i.e., the modules, the bugs we found, the enhancements we wanted, questions we had or general tasks were all posted on Github Issues and labeled properly. The development time for an issue was usually a week. The development time for bugs was definitely much less tahn a week, maybe a day or two. I would usually begin working on a module on a Monday and either finish on the Friday or stretch it to the next Monday. this obviously wasn't a hard and fast rule but something that I generally tried sticking to. There were definitely times I went over a week but my module would generally be my goal for the week.<br><br>

                        About six to seven weeks later, we put a stop to major development. We had 18 modules and that was good enough for now.
